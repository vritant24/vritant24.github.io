# **VRITANT BHARDWAJ**

I am currently a Junior at Purdue University, majoring in Computer Science and focusing on the Software Engineering and the Machine Learning tracks. Furthermore, I am pursuing a certificate in Entrepreneurship. 

My interests and skills lean towards Front-End development for software applications as well as Data Analysis. I consider myself a design minded developer and so, my philosophy is to make user experience and technical functionality to work hand in hand.

Currently looking for an Internship during the Summer of 2018 (May - August)
