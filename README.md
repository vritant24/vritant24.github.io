# **VRITANT BHARDWAJ**

I am currently a Junior at Purdue University, majoring in Computer Science and focusing on the Software Engineering, Systems Programming, and Programming Languages tracks. Furthermore, I am pursuing a certificate in Entrepreneurship. 

I consider myself a design minded developer and like to work with practical applications. My philosophy is to make user experience and technical functionality to work hand in hand.
